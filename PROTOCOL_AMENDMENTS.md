# Protocol amendments

v1.2 (2026-09-26; pre-data; no model outputs exist at the time of this amendment)

- §4.3 filter 1: attestation = ≥2 of {EN-entry translation table, VI-entry
  English gloss, MUSE, Wikidata}. Reason: MUSE's Vietnamese side has 0/73,874
  multi-syllable entries; the v1.1 rule would have limited the concept set to
  monosyllables, undermining C1. Robustness subset: external_attested
  (MUSE or Wikidata).
- §4.4: strata are sino vs nonsino (not native). native_strict (Proto-Vietic/
  Mon-Khmer/Austroasiatic evidence or an inh template) is reported as a
  robustness subset. Reason: only ~7% of pool entries carry native-origin evidence.
- §4.2: POS limited to noun/verb/adj; English lemmas ≤ 2 words; Chinese = Mandarin
  (cmn), Simplified.
